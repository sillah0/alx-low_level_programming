0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. It works by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, where the corresponding values are stored. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of certain operations, such as searching for a specific key, compared to other data structures like arrays or linked lists.
